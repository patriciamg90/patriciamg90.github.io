					I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the City University of New York, New York City College of Technology (City Tech).
					My work connects rigorous mathematical ideas with computation and data-driven modeling, with current interests in
					machine learning for geospatial data (including LiDAR/3D point clouds), feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction.
					My broader background includes analysis, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations, and I enjoy building bridges
					from pure mathematics to applied and computational problems.

					I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela, where I completed my undergraduate studies at the Universidad Central de Venezuela,
					known as “the house that overcomes the shadows.” UNESCO declared the university a World Heritage Site in 2000 due to its
					distinct architectural style. My first contact with research was through probability and statistics, and my undergraduate thesis
					was in nonparametric statistics.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/teleferico-de-merida_resized.jpg" alt="Mérida, Venezuela" /></span>
					I did the first year of my master’s studies at the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas (IVIC), an institute with an
					exceptional library and research environment. I completed the second year at Universidad de los Andes in Mérida, Venezuela, where I
					learned Banach space theory and was introduced to Orlicz spaces, the topic of my master’s thesis. This early work in functional analysis
					played a central role in inspiring me to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/usb-vegetal_resized.jpg" alt="Universidad Simón Bolívar" /></span>
					After completing my master’s degree, I returned to Caracas and taught at two institutions: Universidad Central de Venezuela and
					Universidad Simón Bolívar. A few years later, I continued graduate studies at Bowling Green State University, where I earned a second
					master’s degree and deepened my background in analysis, complex analysis, topology, and numerical analysis.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/osu-hero_resized.jpg" alt="Oregon State University" /></span>
					In 2009, I began my Ph.D. at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. I completed my dissertation under the direction of
					Dr. Malgorzata Peszyńska, who introduced me to applied mathematics problems and mathematical modeling for physical phenomena,
					including methane hydrates and adsorption models in porous media.
				</p>

				<p>
					While at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), I worked on machine learning projects with Dr. Randy Paffenroth. That experience,
					together with collaborations from the AWM Women in Data Science and Mathematics (WiSDM) group, shaped many of the ideas I continue
					to develop—especially connecting mathematical structure to feature engineering and learning pipelines.
				</p>

				<p>
					I was also a postdoctoral visiting scholar at ICERM (Brown University) during the Spring 2019 Computer Vision program. The program
					provided an unusually rich environment for interdisciplinary research and collaboration, and it continues to influence how I think about
					bridging mathematical foundations and computational practice.
