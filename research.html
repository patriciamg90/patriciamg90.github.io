				<p>
					My research develops mathematically grounded tools for modern data problems, with a focus on building
					<strong>mathematical frameworks for machine learning</strong>. A recurring theme is designing representations
					and features that are both computationally effective and mathematically interpretable. This includes
					<strong>feature engineering</strong> inspired by measure theory and functional analysis, and
					<strong>dimensionality reduction</strong> methods (e.g., PCA and autoencoders) for high-dimensional and
					geometric data such as LiDAR/3D point clouds.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also work in <strong>numerical analysis</strong> and <strong>partial differential equations (PDEs)</strong>,
					including PDE-based models for physical phenomena in porous media and geoscience applications (e.g., methane
					hydrates and adsorption models).
				</p>

				<p>
					Before focusing on machine learning and computational research, I worked in <strong>functional analysis</strong>,
					with particular emphasis on <strong>Banach space theory</strong> and <strong>Orlicz spaces</strong>.
					This early work played a central role in my decision to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. My broad background
					continues to shape how I approach research: I enjoy connecting ideas across areas—from pure mathematics to
					computation and real-world data.

					<h4>Machine learning on LiDAR / 3D point clouds</h4>
					My work on LiDAR data grew out of research collaborations in data science and geometry-informed learning.
					A major motivation is that point cloud data are high-dimensional, noisy, and often contain structure at
					multiple scales. I am interested in improving classification pipelines by combining:
					(i) mathematically motivated feature engineering, (ii) dimensionality reduction, and (iii) learning models
					suited to geometric data.
				</p>

				<p>
					One line of work focuses on using learned representations (e.g., autoencoders) together with engineered features
					to classify points into relevant classes (for example, distinguishing ground versus non-ground points and refining
					labels based on morphology and local structure). Typical features in LiDAR datasets include spatial coordinates,
					intensity, number of returns, and (when available) RGB information. Beyond standard feature sets, my goal is to
					develop descriptors motivated by rigorous mathematical ideas (e.g., measure-theoretic quantities defined on
					dyadic neighborhood structures) to improve performance and interpretability.

					<h4>Remote sensing: vegetation classification and climate-related applications</h4>
					Over the last decade, collaborators in remote sensing and geospatial analysis have collected and analyzed LiDAR point cloud
					data across different sites using both direct (labor-intensive) and indirect methods. A motivating application is estimating
					forest structure parameters from LiDAR, including leaf area index (LAI) and related canopy measures. A general approach is to
					combine engineered features and multi-scale geometric descriptors with dimensionality reduction (linear methods such as PCA and
					nonlinear methods such as autoencoders), followed by learning models such as feed-forward neural networks or ensemble methods.
					Automating classification and structural estimation can significantly accelerate analysis pipelines for large-scale forest data.

					<h4>Methane hydrates</h4>
					I have studied mathematical models for the evolution of methane hydrates in hydrate zones, including simplified models that incorporate
					parameter-dependent solubility constraints. These constraints can be represented using nonlinear complementarity conditions.
					This work includes analysis of solvability and properties of fully discrete numerical schemes.

					<h4>Thermodynamically consistent adsorption models</h4>
					Multicomponent adsorption is often described by systems of conservation laws whose nonlinear flux terms are derived from isotherms.
					Many commonly used isotherms (e.g., extended Langmuir variants) are thermodynamically inconsistent. My work studies analysis and numerical
					approximation of adsorption systems with thermodynamically consistent isotherms that are specified implicitly or obtained from coupled
					microscopic models, including stability considerations for numerical schemes.
