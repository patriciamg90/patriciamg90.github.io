					LiDAR point clouds contain measurements of complicated natural scenes
and can be used to update digital elevation models, glacial monitoring, detecting
faults and measuring uplift detecting, forest inventory, detect shoreline and beach
volume changes, landslide risk analysis, habitat mapping and urban development,
among others. A very important application is the classification of the 3D cloud
into elementary classes. For example, it can be used to differentiate between vegetation,
man-made structures and water. Our goal is to present a preliminary comparison
study for classification of 3D point cloud LiDAR data that includes several
types of feature engineering. In particular, we demonstrate that providing context by
augmenting each point in the LiDAR point cloud with information about its neighboring
points can improve the performance of downstream learning algorithms. We
also experiment with several dimension reduction strategies, ranging from Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) to neural network based auto-encoders, and demonstrate
how they affect classification performance in LiDAR point clouds. For instance,
we observe that combining feature engineering with a dimension reduction
method such as PCA, there is an improvement in the accuracy of the classification
with respect to doing a straightforward classification with the raw data.

					simplified model for evolution of methane hydrates in the hydrate zone, which includes a parameter-dependent
					maximum solubility constraint represented as a nonlinear complementarity constraint (for solubility).
					Our model consists of a single PDE and two unknowns (solubility and saturation), which are bounded by 
					a parameter dependent family of graphs. We have already analyzed solvability and other properties of 
					the fully discrete scheme for the model.</p>

					adsorption with subscale diffusion and memory terms.</h4>
					Multicomponent adsorption is typically described by a system of conservation laws in which the nonlinear flux terms come
					from explicit functional relationships called isotherms. The most popular extended Langmuir isotherm is thermodynamically 
					inconsistent. We discuss analysis and numerical approximation of a multicomponent adsorption system where the thermodynamically
					consistent isotherms are given only implicitly, or from a coupled microscopic model. I am currently developing more examples and 
					analyzing the stability of the system scheme.</p>
